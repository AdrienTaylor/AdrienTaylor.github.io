  abstract={We show that learning-rate schedules for large model training behave surprisingly similar to a performance bound from non-smooth convex optimization theory. We provide a bound for the constant schedule with linear cooldown; in particular, the practical benefit of cooldown is reflected in the bound due to the absence of logarithmic terms. Further, we show that this surprisingly close match between optimization theory and practice can be exploited for learning-rate tuning: we achieve noticeable improvements for training 124M and 210M Llama-type models by (i) extending the schedule for continued training with optimal learning-rate, and (ii) transferring the optimal learning-rate across schedules.},

  abstract={It is well known that functions (resp. operators) satisfying a property~$p$ on a subset $Q\subset \R^d$ cannot necessarily be extended to a function (resp. operator) satisfying~$p$ on the whole of~$\R^d$. Given $Q \subseteq \R^d$, this work considers the problem of obtaining necessary and ideally sufficient conditions to be satisfied by a function (resp. operator) on $Q$, ensuring the existence of an extension of this function (resp. operator) satisfying $p$ on $\R^d$.    More precisely, given some property $p$, we present a refinement procedure to obtain stronger necessary conditions to be imposed on $Q$. This procedure can be applied iteratively until the stronger conditions are also sufficient. We illustrate the procedure on a few examples, including the strengthening of existing descriptions for the classes of smooth functions satisfying a \L{}ojasiewicz condition, convex blockwise smooth functions, Lipschitz monotone operators, strongly monotone cocoercive operators, and uniformly convex functions. In most cases, these strengthened descriptions can be represented, or relaxed, to semi-definite constraints, which can be used to formulate tractable optimization problems on functions (resp. operators) within those classes.},

  abstract={Communication between agents often constitutes a major computational bottleneck in distributed learning. One of the most common mitigation strategies is to compress the information exchanged, thereby reducing communication overhead. To counteract the degradation in convergence associated with compressed communication, error feedback schemes -- most notably EF and EF21 -- were introduced. In this work, we provide a tight analysis of both of these methods. Specifically, we find the Lyapunov function that yields the best possible convergence rate for each method -- with matching lower bounds. This principled approach yields sharp performance guarantees and enables a rigorous, apples-to-apples comparison between EF, EF21, and compressed gradient descent. Our analysis is carried out in a simplified yet representative setting, which allows for clean theoretical insights and fair comparison of the underlying mechanisms. },

We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a quadratic Lyapunov inequality that amounts to solving a small-sized semidefinite program.

  abstract={The goal of this thesis is to show how to derive in a completely automated way exact and global worst-case guarantees for first-order methods in convex optimization. To this end, we formulate a generic optimization problem looking for the worst-case scenarios. The worst-case computation problems, referred to as performance estimation problems (PEPs), are intrinsically infinite-dimensional optimization problems formulated over a given class of objective functions. To render those problems tractable, we develop (smooth and non-smooth) convex interpolation framework, which provides necessary and sufficient conditions to interpolate our objective functions. With this idea, we transform PEPs into solvable finite-dimensional semidefinite programs, from which one obtains worst-case guarantees and worst-case functions, along with the corresponding explicit proofs. PEPs already proved themselves very useful as a tool for developing convergence analyses of first-order optimization methods. Among others, PEPs allow obtaining exact guarantees for gradient methods, along with their inexact, projected, proximal, conditional, decentralized and accelerated versions.},

  abstract={Convex Quadratic programming (QP) has become a core component in the modern engineering toolkit, particularly in robotics, where QP problems are legions, ranging from real-time whole-body controllers to planning and estimation algorithms. Many of those QPs need to be solved at high frequency. Meeting timing requirements requires taking advantage of as many structural properties as possible for the problem at hand. For instance, it is generally crucial to resort to warm-starting to exploit the resemblance of consecutive control iterations. While a large range of off-the-shelf QP solvers is available, only a few are suited to exploit problem structure and warm-starting capacities adequately. In this work, we propose the PROXQP algorithm, a new and efficient QP solver that exploits QP structures by leveraging primal-dual augmented Lagrangian techniques. For convex QPs, PROXQP features a global convergence guarantee to the closest feasible QP, an essential property for safe closedloop control. We illustrate its practical performance on various standard robotic and control experiments, including a real-world closed-loop model predictive control application. While originally tailored for robotics applications, we show that PROXQP also performs at the level of state of the art on generic QP problems, making PROXQP suitable for use as an off-the-shelf solver for regular applications beyond robotics.},

	abstract={In this work, we propose an adaptive variation on the classical Heavy-ball method for convex quadratic minimization. The adaptivity crucially relies on so-called ``Polyak step-sizes'', which consists in using the knowledge of the optimal value of the optimization problem at hand instead of problem parameters such as a few eigenvalues of the Hessian of the problem. This method happens to also be equivalent to a variation of the classical conjugate gradient method, and thereby inherits many of its attractive features, including its finite-time convergence, instance optimality, and its worst-case convergence rates.
	The classical gradient method with Polyak step-sizes is known to behave very well in situations in which it can be used, and the question of whether incorporating momentum in this method is possible and can improve the method itself appeared to be open. We provide a definitive answer to this question for minimizing convex quadratic functions, a arguably necessary first step for developing such methods in more general setups.}

The key underlying idea is to cast the problem of performing a worst-case analysis, often referred to as a performance estimation problem (PEP), as a semidefinite program (SDP) which can be solved numerically. For doing that, the package users are only required to write first-order methods nearly as they would have implemented them. The package then takes care of the SDP modelling parts, and the worst-case analysis is performed numerically via a standard solver. },

  abstract={Optimization layers within neural network architectures have become increasingly popular for their ability to solve a wide range of machine learning tasks and to model domain-specific knowledge. However, designing optimization layers requires careful consideration as the underlying optimization problems might be infeasible during training. Motivated by applications in learning, control, and robotics, this work focuses on convex quadratic programming (QP) layers. The specific structure of this type of optimization layer can be efficiently exploited for faster computations while still allowing rich modeling capabilities. We leverage primal-dual augmented Lagrangian techniques for computing derivatives of both feasible and infeasible QPs. Not requiring feasibility allows, as a byproduct, for more flexibility in the QP to be learned. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated in a few standard learning experiments, obtaining three to ten times faster computations than alternative state-of-the-art methods while being more accurate and numerically robust. Along with these contributions, we provide an open-source C++ software package called QPLayer for efficiently differentiating convex QPs and which can be interfaced with modern learning frameworks.}

In this work, we propose an approach to automate the search for cyclic trajectories generated by first-order methods. This provides a constructive approach to show that no appropriate complexity bound exists, thereby complementing the approaches providing sufficient conditions for convergence. Using this tool, we provide ranges of parameters for which some of the famous heavy-ball, Nesterov accelerated gradient, inexact gradient descent, and three-operator splitting algorithms fail to systematically converge, and show that it nicely complements existing tools searching for Lyapunov functions. },

To the best of our knowledge, this result closes a simple yet open question on one of the most used and iconic first-order optimization technique. Our approach builds on finding functions for which $\HB$ fails to converge and instead cycles over finitely many iterates. We analytically describe all parametrizations of $\HB$ that exhibit this cycling behavior on a particular cycle shape, whose choice is supported by a systematic and constructive approach to the study of cycling behaviors of first-order methods.

Then, we show that worst-case guarantees for algorithms relying on such inexact proximal operations can be systematically obtained through a generic procedure based on semidefinite programming. This methodology is primarily based on the approach introduced by Drori and Teboulle (2014) and on convex interpolation results, and allows producing non-improvable worst-case analyzes.

	abstract={The Past Extragradient (PEG) [Popov, 1980] method, also known as the Optimistic Gradient method, has known a recent gain in interest in the optimization community with the emergence of variational inequality formulations for machine learning. Recently, in the unconstrained case, Golowich et al. [2020] proved that a $O(1/N)$ last-iterate convergence rate in terms of the squared norm of the operator can be achieved for Lipschitz and monotone operators with a Lipschitz Jacobian. In this work, by introducing a novel analysis through potential functions, we show that (i) this $O(1/N)$ last-iterate convergence can be achieved without any assumption on the Jacobian of the operator, and (ii) it can be extended to the constrained case, which was not derived before even under Lipschitzness of the Jacobian. The proof is significantly different from the one known from Golowich et al. [2020], and its discovery was computer-aided. Those results close the open question of the last iterate convergence of PEG for monotone variational inequalities.}

One of those functions has Lipschitz-continuous gradients, and can be accessed via stochastic oracles, whereas the other is "simple". We provide a Bregman-type algorithm with accelerated convergence in function values to a ball containing the minimum. The radius of this ball depends on problem-dependent constants, including the variance of the stochastic oracle. We further show that this algorithmic setup naturally leads to a variant of Frank-Wolfe achieving acceleration under parallelization. More precisely, when minimizing a smooth convex function on a bounded domain, we show that one can achieve an $\epsilon$  primal-dual gap (in expectation) in $\tilde{O}(1/\sqrt{ \epsilon})$ iterations, by only accessing gradients of the original function and a linear maximization oracle with $O(1/\sqrt{ \epsilon})$ computing units in parallel. We illustrate this fast convergence on synthetic numerical experiments.}

	We provide a thorough analysis of first-order methods, including worst-case convergence guarantees for several algorithms, and demonstrate that some of them achieve the optimal worst-case guarantee over the class. We support our analysis by numerical validation of worst-case guarantees using performance estimation problems. A few observations can be drawn from this analysis, particularly regarding the optimality (resp. and adaptivity) of the heavy-ball method (resp. heavy-ball with line-search). Finally, we show how our analysis can be leveraged to obtain convergence guarantees over more complex classes of functions. Overall, this study brings insights on the choice of function classes over which standard first-order methods have working worst-case guarantees.}

Yet, modern numerical solvers have not reached the level of efficiency and reliability required in practical applications where speed, robustness, and accuracy are all necessary. In this work, we introduce a few variations of the well-established augmented Lagrangian method, specifically for solving QPs, which include heuristics for improving practical numerical performances. Those variants are embedded within an open-source software which includes an efficient C++ implementation, a modular API, as well as best-performing heuristics for our test-bed. Relying on this framework, we present a benchmark studying the practical performances of modern optimization solvers for convex QPs on generic and complex problems of the literature as well as on common robotic scenarios. This benchmark notably highlights that this approach outperforms modern solvers in terms of efficiency, accuracy and robustness for small to medium-sized problems, while remaining competitive for higher dimensions.},

We first use quadratic optimization problems to introduce two key families of methods, namely momentum and nested optimization schemes. They coincide in the quadratic case to form the Chebyshev method.

We discuss momentum methods in detail, starting with the seminal work of Nesterov [1] and structure convergence proofs using a few master templates, such as that for optimized gradient methods, which provide the key benefit of showing how momentum methods optimize convergence guarantees. We further cover proximal acceleration, at the heart of the Catalyst and Accelerated Hybrid Proximal Extragradient frameworks, using similar algorithmic patterns.

Common acceleration techniques rely directly on the knowledge of some of the regularity parameters in the problem at hand. We conclude by discussing restart schemes, a set of simple techniques for reaching nearly optimal convergence rates while adapting to unobserved regularity parameters.},

	Finding the worst-case performance of a black-box first-order method is formulated as an optimization problem over a set of smooth (strongly) convex functions and initial conditions. We develop closed-form necessary and sufficient conditions for smooth (strongly) convex interpolation, which provide a finite representation for those functions. This allows us to reformulate the worst-case performance estimation problem as an equivalent finite dimension-independent semidefinite optimization problem, whose exact solution can be recovered up to numerical precision. Optimal solutions to this performance estimation problem provide both worst-case performance bounds and explicit functions matching them, as our smooth (strongly) convex interpolation procedure is constructive.
	Our works build on those of Drori and Teboulle in [Math. Prog. 145 (1-2), 2014] who introduced and solved relaxations of the performance estimation problem for smooth convex functions.
	We apply our approach to different fixed-step first-order methods with several performance criteria, including objective function accuracy and gradient norm. We conjecture several numerically supported worst-case bounds on the performance of the fixed-step gradient, fast gradient and optimized gradient methods, both in the smooth convex and the smooth strongly convex cases, and deduce tight estimates of the optimal step size for the gradient method.},

	abstract={The goal of this thesis is to show how to derive in a completely automated way exact and global worst-case guarantees for first-order methods in convex optimization. To this end, we formulate a generic optimization problem looking for the worst-case scenarios. The worst-case computation problems, referred to as performance estimation problems (PEPs), are intrinsically infinite-dimensional optimization problems formulated over a given class of objective functions. To render those problems tractable, we develop (smooth and non-smooth) convex interpolation framework, which provides necessary and sufficient conditions to interpolate our objective functions. With this idea, we transform PEPs into solvable finite-dimensional semidefinite programs, from which one obtains worst-case guarantees and worst-case functions, along with the corresponding explicit proofs. PEPs already proved themselves very useful as a tool for developing convergence analyses of first-order optimization methods. Among others, PEPs allow obtaining exact guarantees for gradient methods, along with their inexact, projected, proximal, conditional, decentralized and accelerated versions.},
