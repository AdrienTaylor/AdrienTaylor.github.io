**worst-case analyses for first-order optimization methods ---** If you want to get familiar with performance estimation problems, you might be interested in checking this [blog post](https://francisbach.com/computer-aided-analyses/), and those [introductory exercises](https://github.com/PerformanceEstimation/Learning-Performance-Estimation). Two packages allow playing with performance estimation problems without spending too much time in the details: *PESTO* (in Matlab, see [Github](https://github.com/AdrienTaylor/Performance-Estimation-Toolbox), and [documentation](https://github.com/AdrienTaylor/Performance-Estimation-Toolbox/blob/master/UserGuide.pdf)) and *PEPit* (in Python, see [Github](https://github.com/bgoujaud/PEPit), and [documentation](https://pepit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)). Both packages contain more than 50 examples of applications.

**accelerated first-order methods ---** we recently published a monograph on [acceleration methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09545) (with [Alexandre d'Aspremont](https://www.di.ens.fr/~aspremon/) and [Damien Scieur](https://damienscieur.com/)) as well as a nice [continuized approach to Nesterov's acceleration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.07644) ([Mathieu Even](https://mathieueven.netlify.app/), [Raphael Berthier](https://raphael-berthier.github.io/), et al.) which received an **[outstanding paper award](https://blog.neurips.cc/2021/11/30/announcing-the-neurips-2021-award-recipients/?s=09)** at NeurIPS 2021. We also discovered a definitive answer to the black-box complexity of large-scale smooth strongly convex minimization with [Yoel Drori](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7pRQY3MAAAAJ&hl=en) (in two papers: [lower complexity bound](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0885064X21000455) and [matching upper bound](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09741)).
