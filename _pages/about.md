## short biography
hello !

I am currently a research scientist at Inria, within the [SIERRA](https://www.di.ens.fr/sierra/) team. Before that, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the same team in 2017-2019, working with [Francis Bach](http://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/). I completed a PhD at [Université catholique de Louvain](http://www.uclouvain.be), in the [department of mathematical engineering](http://www.uclouvain.be/inma) (part of the [ICTEAM](http://www.uclouvain.be/en-icteam.html) institute), where I was holding a [F.R.S.-FNRS FRIA](http://www.fnrs.be/) scholarship for my PhD under the supervision of [François Glineur](http://perso.uclouvain.be/francois.glineur) and [Julien Hendrickx](http://perso.uclouvain.be/julien.hendrickx).


My research currently focuses on optimization (mostly first-order) and numerical analysis with a bit of control and machine learning. I find it particularly important to push toward reproducible (including theory) and understandable science, and many of my research projects have this orientation.
 
**tutorial & slides ---** selected sets of slides can be found [here](/tutorials), together with references to tutorials to accelerated first-order methods and principled (and computer-assisted) worst-case analyses.
