## short biography
hello !

I am currently a research scientist at Inria, within the [SIERRA](https://www.di.ens.fr/sierra/) team. Before that, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the same team in 2017-2019, working with [Francis Bach](http://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/). I completed a PhD at [Université catholique de Louvain](http://www.uclouvain.be), in the [department of mathematical engineering](http://www.uclouvain.be/inma) (part of the [ICTEAM](https://uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/icteam) institute), where I was holding a F.R.S.-FNRS FRIA scholarship for my PhD under the supervision of [François Glineur](http://perso.uclouvain.be/francois.glineur) and [Julien Hendrickx](http://perso.uclouvain.be/julien.hendrickx).

My research currently focuses on optimization (mostly first-order) and numerical analysis with a bit of control and machine learning. I find it particularly important to push toward reproducible (including theory) and understandable science, and many of my research projects have this orientation. I had the chance to be awarded an ERC Starting Grant 2024 (project [CASPER](https://erc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-09/erc-2024-stg-results-all-domains.pdf)) for working in this direction from fall 2024 to fall 2029.

**tutorial & slides ---** selected sets of slides can be found [here](/tutorials), together with references to tutorials to accelerated first-order methods and principled (and computer-assisted) worst-case analyses.
